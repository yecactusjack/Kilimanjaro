Role: You are an expert web designer and full-stack developer with a strong focus on clean, minimalistic design.

Task: Create a single-page website concept that highlights the mission and offerings of a company called “Goldbach Labs.” The site should have a polished, professional look, using a minimal color palette (white, black, and subtle accent colors) and clean typography.

Website Goals:

Present a bold hero section with a headline, sub-headline, and a prominent call-to-action button (e.g., “Get Started”).
Showcase a Mission Statement that explains what the company does in concise, engaging language.
Provide feature cards or sections illustrating the key benefits or capabilities (e.g., “Natural Language Interface,” “Automated Pipeline Selection,” “Accessibility,” etc.).
End with a clear call-to-action (like “Back to Kilimanjaro” or “Learn More”) to guide users.
Desired Style & Layout:

Hero Section:
Large, bold headline centered on the page.
Sub-headline or tagline beneath, explaining the core benefit.
A call-to-action button (“Get Started”) that stands out.
A second, smaller button or link (e.g., “Back to Kilimanjaro”) for secondary navigation.
Mission Statement:
A white background with a subtle dividing line or a simple layout that draws the user’s eye.
A short paragraph describing how modern bioinformatics workflows are complex and how Goldbach Labs’ solution makes them simpler and more efficient.
Key Features or Services:
A row or grid of feature cards, each containing an icon, a short heading, and a concise description (e.g., “Natural Language Interface,” “Automated Pipeline Selection,” “Accessibility,” etc.).
Use minimal icons or simple line art.
Typography & Colors:
Main colors: white background, black text, subtle accent color (e.g., a soft blue) for buttons and highlights.
Fonts: Clean, sans-serif typeface (e.g., Inter, Helvetica, or similar).
Responsive Design:
Ensure the layout adapts nicely on mobile devices (stacked sections, properly sized fonts/buttons).
Footer or Final Call-to-Action:
Possibly a simple, centered statement or button to learn more about the company or link to another resource.
Code & Structure:

Generate HTML5 and CSS (and optionally JavaScript) that follows modern best practices.
Make sure the code is well-commented to explain key layout decisions.
If using a framework like React, Next.js, or Vue, structure the components accordingly. If using plain HTML/CSS/JS, ensure the structure is semantic and easy to read.
Output:

Provide a detailed HTML file (or React component structure) that includes the hero section, mission statement, features section, and a final CTA.
Include a CSS snippet or a styled-components approach that demonstrates how to achieve the clean, minimal aesthetic.
Provide brief explanations (inline or in a separate section) on how to customize text, colors, and images.
Additional Notes:

Focus on clarity and simplicity.
Use consistent spacing and alignment to create a polished look.
Ensure the website conveys a feeling of professionalism and innovation.
You can include placeholder images or icons where needed.
Provide instructions on how to change or add new sections as the company evolves.
